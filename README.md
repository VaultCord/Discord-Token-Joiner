## Is this safe?

Yes, this program is safe. Here's why:

- The source code is completely open. So you can be 100% sure it's innocent code
- You can run our program on https://tria.ge/ or **Windows Sandbox** or any RDP server. We do <ins>**NOT**</ins> block Virtual Machines

Your botted Discord tokens are never sent to us. They are only used on Discord's authorization page to create OAuth2 API keys https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#client-credentials-grant
<br><br>
These OAuth2 API keys only have the permission of joining servers. No messages, or any other private data can be accessed.
